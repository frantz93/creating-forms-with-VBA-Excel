## Implementing an automate process for collecting and cleaning data on Excel, using VBA programming
I made this program during covid-19 pandemic. It is designed to collect data in the form of a survey. The program is intended to build a database that can be used to assess the willingness to pay of consumers for FFP2 masks. Such masks were promoted for providing a better protection against covid-19 virus.
